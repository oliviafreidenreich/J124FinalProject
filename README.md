## Cleaning Data

Once I found my dataset, I began importing the data to my GoogleSheets document and cleaning it. I used Adobe Illustrator to copy the data into csv format and then uploaded it to google drive and pasted it sheet by sheet onto a cohesive document. 

I froze and bolded the headings on each sheet. I used the original titles for each, but made my own titles to label the bottom tabs for easy access. I also made duplicates of each sheet before I cleaned it and labeled those “Copy” and the table they were replicating.

To begin cleaning, I converted all of the percent columns into percentages and reduced the trailing zeroes so they were whole numbers:

![Decimal form, Percent columns with numbers in decimal form](/J124Cleaning1)

!['Name I give the image','Alt text desscribes the image'](/File path to the image OR an image URL)
